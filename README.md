I'd like to suggest a task. Create a function that can be used to determine if a word/phrase is a palindrome or not (spelled the same forward and backwords). Generally, with functions like this, you'd ignore punctuation, spaces, and capitalization. Although, anything is some practice! A couple of test cases to assure your function works correctly: Single words: radar, racecar, madam, Phrases with spaces: "nurses run", "step on no pets", "top spot" Phrases with punctuation and spaces: "Don't nod", "I did, did I?", "Red rum, sir, is murder"
